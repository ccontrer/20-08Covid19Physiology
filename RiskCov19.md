# Normal Tissue Complication Model

The aim of Normal Tissue Complication Model is to compute risk of viral infections based of viral dynamics and survival probability.

## How to use the code

The code is writen in `julia` (see requirements and compatibility  bellow) and uses MCMC simulations to estimate the the hazard ratios, cofactor coefficients,
